    <h2>100 Days of Code</h2>
    <h3>Day 1: <date datetime="2018/07/23">July 23, 2018</date></h3>
    <p>
        It's been too long since I've done any web development studying 
        just for me. I've been cramming to learn WordPress and it's been
        eating at me that I haven't been working on JavaScript. I'm 
        constantly worrying that I will forget everything I've learned.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today I had nothing to do as I sat around waiting to find out if I'd
        be flying to Phoenix to help a friend. I decided to check in with my 
        FreeCodeCamp progress while I waited and since I didn't leave today, 
        I spent a lot of hours on Web Accessibility and FlexBox. It felt so
        good to write some html and css. It's been too long.
    </p>
    <p>
        After I decided my brain wouldn't retain anything if I moved onto the 
        next section I logged into my even more neglected <a href='https://www.codewars.com/users/mandimh/completed_solutions'>
        codewars account</a> and 
        solved the <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/54ba84be607a92aa900000f1">Isograms challenge</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Isograms challenge requires that you take a string and return true if each letter in
        the string is present only one time. If the letter is present more than once (consecutive or not),
        then the function should return false. Immediately I knew I would need a Regular Expression. I 
        also knew that my regex skills were rusty. I couldn't think of how to write a regex that would
        test for a single occurance of a letter. So what I decided to do was to first split the string into
        an array, then using a forEach loop, use each letter in a regular expression, and using .match()
        return false if the array returned from .match() was longer than 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        The solution worked, but I wished I had remembered how to use regular expressions to solve the 
        challenge in fewer steps.
    </p>
   
    <h3>Solution</h3> 
    <p>
        <code> isIsogram(str){<br></code>
            <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;// split string to array <br></code>
            <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;let arr = str.split(''); <br></code>
            <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;// isTrue tracks whether each letter is found only once in the string
            let isTrue = true;</code>
            <br>
            <br>
            <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;// for each item in array, check the original string to see if there is 
            <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;//more than 1 instance of that letter <br></code>
            <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;arr.forEach(element => { <br></code>
            
            <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    let regex = new RegExp(element, 'gi'); <br></code>
            <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    let matchArr = str.match(regex); <br></code>
            <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    if (matchArr.length > 1) { <br></code>
            <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      console.log("inside if") <br></code>
            <code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     return isTrue = false; <br></code>
            <code> &nbsp;&nbsp;   }  <br></code>
            <code>}) <br></code>
            <code>return isTrue; <br></code>
          <code>} <br></code>
